        <p>
            Hello, my name is Tim Maupin and welcome to my webpage! I graduated from Saint mary's College of California
            with a bachelor's degree in Sociology. I have had a few jobs in my life from working with Red Bull in
            college as a campus rep to being a woodshop worker. However, I spent the most of the last six yuears playing
            professional rugby both in Ireland and here in the United States. I am hoping that with the knowledge and
            understanding that I gain from this course I am able to gind a job that will be able to provide myself and
            hopefully one day a family with a good standard of living. It would be a plus to find something that I
            really enjoy in an industry, but I have already lived out my dream job so I can't really ask for more than
            that.
